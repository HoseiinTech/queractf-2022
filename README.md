# Hackathon CTF Challenge 2023
This challenge was my first official experience in ctf and the field of security. Although I did not expect to get an interesting rank, but with the strong team we had, we got a relatively good rank.
Of course, the level of questions was a little difficult for the first experience, but we solved most of the questions.

In this repo, we decided to present our own team's write-ups about these issues :D
